# CodeBook for Getting & Cleaning Data Assignment - Week 4

The codebook explains the variables, the source of data, all transformations made, and other information worth noting.

# The Key Data Sources
Description of dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Zipped Data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# Information about the Data
This experiment looks at information of volunteers within the age group of 19 - 48 years. Each person performed six 
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung 
Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration 
and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data 
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected
for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-
width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and 
gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff 
frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and 
frequency domain.

# Data
The dataset contains the following files:
'README.txt'
'features.txt': List of all features.
'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
# Files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity 
units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' 
files for the Y and Z axis.
